## [3.36.0] — 2026-04-26 — Tier 4 Phase B: Medium Skills Ultra-Thin

**Theme:** All 4 Medium skills (retro/evolve/council/analyze) migrated to ultra-thin shells. Single-source-of-truth aggregate MCP tools pattern proven across post-processing, autonomous loops, parallel agents, and brownfield analysis.

### Changed (skill migration)
- `samvil-retro`: 506 → 117 LOC (-77%)
- `samvil-evolve`: 482 → 91 LOC (-81%)
- `samvil-council`: 554 → 107 LOC (-81%) — parallel Agent() calls preserved in skill, before/after logic in MCP
- `samvil-analyze`: 677 → 80 LOC (-88%) — heaviest reverse-engineering moved to MCP
- Phase B total: 2,219 → 395 LOC (-82%, target was -69%)
- Each skill preserves SKILL.legacy.md (frontmatter renamed to avoid loader collision)

### Added (MCP — aggregate pattern)
- `aggregate_retro_metrics(project_root, plugin_root, suggestion_major)` — single source of truth for retro metric aggregation, recurring-pattern detection, suggestion ID increment
- `aggregate_evolve_context(project_root)` — boot-time aggregator for auto-trigger detection, mode resolution, cycle counter, 4-dim baseline
- `synthesize_council_verdicts(round1_verdicts_json, round2_verdicts_json)` — Round 1 → debate-point extraction + Round 2 prompt assembly + final consensus/dissent/blocking aggregation
- `analyze_brownfield_project(project_root)` — reverse-seed generation from existing code (framework detection / module discovery / feature inference / confidence tagging / ADR-EXISTING suggestions)

### Added (tests)
- 85 new smoke tests (16 retro + 19 evolve + 22 council + 28 analyze) pinning behavior contracts

### Behavior changes (intentional)
- **samvil-analyze framework precedence**: Phaser/Expo deps now win over Vite/Astro config files (was: legacy false-positive `framework: react` for Phaser-on-Vite). Re-analyzing brownfield projects may produce a different `framework` value if they're games. Intentional fix per v3.1.0 universal builder design.

### Counts
- MCP tools: 141 → **145** (+4)
- Tests: 979 → **1064** (+85)
- 10 thin skills total (Phase A 6 + Phase B 4) — all ≤120 LOC active

### Limitations (deferred)
- `samvil-analyze` feature inference assumes `src/` layout. Next.js App Router projects with `app/`-only layouts produce empty features + warning. Future patch can extend `discover_modules`.

### Next
Tier 4 Phase C — Hard 5 skills migration (samvil / interview / build / scaffold / qa). Most complex tier. Target eventual v4.0.0 (consolidation milestone).

---

## [3.35.0] — 2026-04-26 — Tier 3 Phase A: Easy Skills Ultra-Thin

**Theme:** Migrate Easy 4 skills (doctor/pm-interview/update/deploy) to ultra-thin shells with single-source-of-truth MCP tools.

### Changed (skill migration)
- `samvil-doctor`: 178 → 87 LOC (-51%)
- `samvil-pm-interview`: 117 → 94 LOC (-20%)
- `samvil-update`: 285 → 120 LOC (-58%)
- `samvil-deploy`: 379 → 99 LOC (-74%)
- Phase A total: 959 → 400 LOC (-58%)
- Each skill preserves SKILL.legacy.md for rollback (frontmatter renamed to avoid name collision)

### Added (MCP)
- `diagnose_environment(project_root)` — single-source-of-truth diagnostic for samvil-doctor (mcp_health, tool_inventory, model_recommendation)
- `evaluate_deploy_target(project_root, platform)` — single-source-of-truth for samvil-deploy (5 solution_types × 4-5 platforms catalog, QA gate, env validation)

### Added (tests)
- 41 new smoke tests pinning behavioral contracts (9 doctor + 8 pm-interview + 7 update + 17 deploy)

### Counts
- MCP tools: 139 → **141** (+2)
- Tests: 938 → **979** (+41)
- 6 thin skills total: samvil-seed (91), samvil-design (116), samvil-doctor (87), samvil-pm-interview (94), samvil-update (120), samvil-deploy (99) — all ≤120 LOC

### Next
Tier 4 — Phase B+C: Medium 4 + Hard 5 skills migration. Target v3.36.0+ → eventual v4.0.0.

---

## [3.34.0] — 2026-04-26 — Consolidation Tier 2

**Theme:** WARM cleanup, module consolidation, doc/CI hygiene.

### Removed
- 7 unused @mcp.tool() registrations (inspection/repair/evolve dead surface)
- evolve_proposal.py + evolve_apply.py (merged into evolve_execution.py)
- release_publish.py + remote_release.py (merged into release_guards.py)

### Internalized (kept as Python helpers, no MCP exposure)
- 9 inspection/repair/release/evolve helpers

### Changed
- Schema docs: 4 individual schemas → 1 unified `references/samvil-ssot-schema.md` (+ 4 redirect stubs)
- CLAUDE.md: 705 → 457 lines (legacy v0.x~v3.2 versions → docs/CHANGELOG-legacy.md; numeric thresholds → references/decision-boundaries.md)
- Pre-push hook: tag-only pushes no longer trigger version check (was a bug requiring --no-verify on every tag push)

### Added
- scripts/check-broken-references.sh — verifies all .md cross-links resolve
- pre-commit section 9: "Markdown reference integrity" (90 files scanned)

### Counts
- MCP tools: 155 → **139** (-16)
- Modules: 60 → **57** (-3)
- Tests: 946 → **938** (-8 MCP wrapper tests removed; behavior coverage preserved)

### Next
Tier 3 — Phase A skill migration (4 Easy skills → ultra-thin). Target v3.35-v3.38.

---

## [3.33.0] — 2026-04-25 — Consolidation Tier 1

First milestone of the Consolidation phase. Reduces v3.32.0 noise (49%
dead/disconnected baseline) without behavior change. PATCH-only discipline
holds inside consolidation; the MINOR bump reflects user-visible tool
count drop (175 → 155) per the versioning policy.

### Added
- `mcp/tests/test_post_rebuild_qa.py` regression guard for missing
  scaffold-input contract (T1.1, defense-in-depth — bug already fixed in
  `e4f93b1`).

### Changed
- Merged `regression_detector` + `convergence_gate` modules into
  `convergence_check` (T1.3). Module count 60 → 59. Public surface
  preserved through re-exports.

### Removed
- 20 confirmed-COLD MCP tools (T1.2). Tool count 175 → 155 (-12%).
  No skill or test reference remained for the removed tools.

### Verified
- Full test suite: 946 passed (unchanged from v3.32.0).
- MCP server import smoke: 155 tools.
- `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: PASS.
- LOC delta: net negative (server.py -426 lines; merged module is
  smaller than the two it replaces).

### Next
- Tier 2 — WARM analysis + 2 module merges + docs slim. Target
  v3.34-v3.36.

- `agents/qa-functional.md` now states that `PARTIAL` remains passable evidence
  with a count, while `UNIMPLEMENTED` and `FAIL` drive revise/fail outcomes.
- `agents/qa-quality.md` now explicitly reports stubs or missing core behavior
  as quality concerns without reclassifying Pass 2 functional states.

### Verified
- Phase 18 dogfood: PASS.
- Phase 18 pytest: PASS.
- Default release check runner: PASS.
- Release evidence bundle generation from default runner output: PASS.
- Full test suite: 867 passed.

## [3.19.1] — 2026-04-26 — Verified Publisher Fixture Patch

Patch release for Phase 17. The first v3.19.0 publisher run correctly blocked
tag publication when remote CI exposed that fixture dry-run tests still depended
on local `.samvil/release-report.json` state.

### Fixed
- `scripts/publish-verified-release.py` now uses an explicit passing local gate
  stub when `--skip-local-release-checks` is set.
- Publisher fixture tests no longer depend on machine-local or CI-local
  `.samvil/release-report.json` state.

### Verified
- Publisher fixture tests: PASS.
- Default release check runner: PASS.
- Release evidence bundle generation from default runner output: PASS.
- Full test suite: 866 passed.
- MCP server import smoke: 153 tools.
- `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: PASS.

  evaluation and rendering.
- `scripts/publish-verified-release.py` for verified branch push, Actions wait,
  remote artifact gate check, and tag push.
- Publish guard inputs for clean tree, version sync, local/remote tag
  existence, local release gate, remote release gate, branch, and HEAD.
- Dry-run fixture mode for deterministic pass/fail publisher testing.
- Unit and CLI tests for pass, dirty tree, existing tag, and blocked remote
  gate cases.
- Phase 17 planning document under
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-samvil-v3.19-phase17.md`.

### Dogfood
- Publish guard unit tests passed.
- Publisher dry-run fixture pass/fail tests passed.
- Default release runner executed Phase 12/11/10/8 and full pre-commit with all
  five checks passing.

Phase 16 of the multi-host SAMVIL architecture. This release makes remote CI
evidence a deterministic gate by validating both the GitHub Actions run and
the uploaded `samvil-release-evidence` runner artifact.

### Added
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/remote_release.py` for remote release gate evaluation and
  markdown rendering.
- `scripts/check-remote-release-gate.py` for live `gh` checks and deterministic
  fixture mode.
- Remote gate validation for run status/conclusion, expected HEAD, artifact
  release report status, artifact gate verdict, and failed/missing checks.
- Pass/fail remote run and runner artifact fixtures under `mcp/tests/fixtures/`.
- Unit and CLI regression tests for pass, failed run, blocked artifact, and head
  mismatch cases.
- Phase 16 planning document under
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-samvil-v3.18-phase16.md`.

## [3.17.3] — 2026-04-26 — External CI Mirror Fixture Patch

Patch release for Phase 15. The v3.17.2 remote run exposed that retro schema
tests depended on ignored machine-local `harness-feedback.log` state.

### Fixed
- Add committed fixture `mcp/tests/fixtures/harness-feedback.json`.
- Point retro schema tests at the fixture instead of ignored local
  `harness-feedback.log`.

### Verified
- CI workflow validator: PASS.
- Focused workflow pytest: 2 passed.
- Default release check runner: PASS.
- Release evidence bundle generation from default runner output: PASS.

release evidence, then exposed that the CI venv did not install pytest for the
pre-commit full-suite step.

### Fixed
- Install `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` into `mcp/.venv` during GitHub Actions
  setup so `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh` can run the full suite remotely.

## [3.17.1] — 2026-04-26 — External CI Mirror Patch

Patch release for Phase 15. The first remote run proved that artifact evidence
could report `blocked` while the Actions job stayed green because the runner
command was piped through `tee`.

### Fixed
- Install the exact Playwright browser runtime used by Phase 8 fixtures:
  `playwright@1.52.0 install --with-deps chromium`.
- Add `set -o pipefail` to release runner and bundle builder workflow steps so
  command failures propagate to the GitHub Actions job.
- Extend workflow validator and pytest contract coverage for the Playwright
  runtime install and pipefail guard.

### Verified
- CI workflow validator: PASS.
- Focused workflow pytest: 2 passed.
- Default release check runner: PASS.
- Release evidence bundle generation from default runner output: PASS.
- Full test suite: 851 passed.

## [3.9.1] — 2026-04-26 — Telemetry Classifier Patch

Patch release for v3.9 browser dogfood. This fixes a telemetry classifier false
positive where `install_started` was categorized as blocked because `install`
contains the substring `stall`.

### Fixed
- Event categorization now treats `stall`, `stalled`, and `blocked` as explicit
  tokens instead of arbitrary substrings.
- `install_started` + `install_complete` now reports the install stage as
  complete, not blocked.
- Phase 7 browser dogfood now records `install_started`/`install_complete`
  directly instead of using the temporary `package_setup_*` workaround.

### Added
- Regression coverage proving install events stay complete while
  `qa_stall_detected` and `deploy_blocked` still report blocked stages.

### Verified
- Telemetry tests: 8 passed.
- Direct browser dogfood: PASS with `install_started`/`install_complete` and
  `retro=0`.
- Full test suite: 802 passed.
- MCP server import smoke: 133 tools.

- `samvil-status.py` JSON rendering over generated run reports.

### Dogfood
- `saas-dashboard`: pack=`saas-dashboard`, confidence=high, patterns=2,
  modules=3, QA checks=4, events=14, retro=0.
- `browser-game`: pack=`browser-game`, confidence=high, patterns=1,
  modules=1, QA checks=4, events=14, retro=0.

### Verified
- Full test suite: 800 passed.
- MCP server import smoke: 133 tools.
- Cross-host replay: PASS.
- `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: PASS.

## [3.6.0] — 2026-04-26 — Domain Packs

Phase 4 of the multi-host SAMVIL architecture. This adds deterministic
product-domain context that stages can request without embedding long domain
rules in skill bodies.

### Added
- `references/domain-pack-schema.md` documenting the Domain Pack boundary,
  schema, matching, and MCP tool surface.
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/domain_packs.py` with three built-in packs:
  `saas-dashboard`, `browser-game`, and `mobile-habit`.
- Domain Pack MCP tools: `list_domain_packs`, `read_domain_pack`,
  `render_domain_context`, and `match_domain_packs`.
- Deterministic pack matching from seed `solution_type`, domain fields, text
  signals, and core entity hits, including `score`, `confidence`, and
  human-readable `reasons`.
- Unit and MCP wrapper tests for pack filtering, rendering, matching, and
  invalid input handling.

### Changed
- `samvil-interview`, `samvil-design`, `samvil-build`, and `samvil-qa` now
  request `render_domain_context` with stage-specific filters instead of
  copying domain prose.
- `scripts/check-skill-wiring.py` now verifies Domain Pack tool references in
  the wired stage skills.

### Dogfood
- Synthetic seeds for all three built-in packs selected the expected top match
  with high confidence.
- Live-ish SaaS dashboard seed rendered domain context for interview, design,
  build, and QA stages.
- MCP `match_domain_packs` returned `saas-dashboard` with score 11 for the
  live-ish dashboard seed.

### Verified
- Full test suite: 799 passed.
- MCP server import smoke: 133 tools.
- Cross-host replay: PASS.
- `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: PASS.

---

## [3.5.0] — 2026-04-26 — Telemetry + Run Observability

Phase 3 of the multi-host SAMVIL architecture. This adds a deterministic
operator telemetry layer over project state, Claim Ledger, events, MCP health,
continuation markers, retro candidates, and the status surface.

### Added
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/telemetry.py` for deterministic `.samvil/run-report.json`
  generation, reading, markdown rendering, and retro observation derivation.
- Run report MCP tools: `build_run_report`, `read_run_report`,
  `render_run_report`.
- Retro MCP tools: `derive_retro_observations`,
  `append_retro_observations`.
- Event timeline taxonomy for `start`, `complete`, `fail`, `retry`,
  `blocked`, `skip`, and `other`, including per-stage duration and
  failure/retry counters.
- MCP health failure signatures grouped by tool and normalized error text.
- `.samvil/retro-observations.jsonl` append flow with `dedupe_key` suppression.
- `mcp/tests/test_samvil_status_script.py` coverage for the status surface.

### Changed
- `scripts/samvil-status.py` now reads `.samvil/run-report.json` when present
  and prefers it for stage, tier, latest gate verdicts, pending claim count,
  MCP health, continuation, stage timeline, and next action.
- `references/run-report-schema.md` documents run report, retro observation,
  MCP tool, and status-surface contracts.

### Dogfood
- Synthetic project produced a report with 1 failure, 1 retry, stage timeline
  rendering, status output, and 5 retro candidates.
- Live repo dogfood generated `.samvil/run-report.json` for this repository
  and confirmed `samvil-status.py --format json` reports
  `run_report.present=true`.
- Dogfood caught a missing-stage JSON blind spot; status JSON now returns `?`
  instead of `null` when project state has no stage.

### Verified
- Full test suite: 787 passed.
- MCP server import smoke: 129 tools.
- Cross-host replay: PASS.
- `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: PASS.

## [3.4.0] — 2026-04-26 — Multi-Host Runtime + Pattern Registry

Phase 2 of the multi-host SAMVIL architecture. This turns the v3.3 skeleton
into a practical Codex/OpenCode-compatible runtime with repeatable skill
migration rules, portable continuation markers, pattern lookup, smarter
manifest context, and cross-host regression coverage.

### Added
- `references/skill-migration-checklist.md` and
  `scripts/skill-thinness-report.py` for repeatable ultra-thin skill migration.
- `references/host-continuation.md` and
  `scripts/host-continuation-smoke.py` for `.samvil/next-skill.json` schema
  validation.
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/pattern_registry.py` with five built-in patterns:
  Next.js app router, Vite React, Phaser game, Expo mobile, Recharts dashboard.
- Pattern Registry MCP tools: `list_patterns`, `read_pattern`,
  `render_pattern_context`.
- Manifest schema `1.1`: TS/JS/Python import graph extraction, module
  summaries, `summary_generated_by`, `summary_generated_at`, and confidence
  tags such as `imports:regex` and `summary:heuristic`.
- Cross-host replay fixture under `mcp/tests/fixtures/phase2/small-web-app/`
  plus `scripts/phase2-cross-host-smoke.py`.

### Changed
- `skills/samvil-design/SKILL.md` is now a 120-line ultra-thin, host-aware
  entry. The previous 649-line body is preserved as
  `skills/samvil-design/SKILL.legacy.md`.
- `skills/samvil-seed/SKILL.md` and `skills/samvil-design/SKILL.md` now use
  the canonical continuation marker shape.
- `skills/samvil-build/SKILL.md` and `skills/samvil-qa/SKILL.md` now request
  Pattern Registry context by `solution_type` and framework.
- `scripts/pre-commit-check.sh` now verifies migrated skill thinness and
  cross-host continuation replay.

### Still Legacy
- Active high-traffic skills not yet ultra-thin: `samvil-interview`,
  `samvil-build`, `samvil-qa`, `samvil-scaffold`.
- Supporting legacy-active skills still to migrate or retire in later phases:
  `samvil-council`, `samvil-retro`, `samvil-evolve`, `samvil-deploy`.

### Verified
- Full test suite: 773 passed.
- MCP server import smoke: 124 tools.
- Cross-host replay: `claude_code` (`skill_tool`) and `codex_cli`
  (`file_marker`) both reach `seed_next=samvil-design` and
  `design_next=samvil-scaffold`.
- `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: PASS.

---

## [3.3.1] — 2026-04-26 — v3.3 Dogfood Manifest Patch

Patch release from direct v3.3 dogfood on a tiny Vite/React project.

### Fixed
- Codebase Manifest now represents files directly under `src/` as a synthetic
  `src` module. Small apps that start with `src/App.tsx` / `src/main.tsx` no
  longer produce an empty `.samvil/manifest.json`.
- Rendered Manifest context now includes a capped file preview per module, so
  stage-entry AI context exposes representative paths such as `src/App.tsx`
  instead of only module names.

### Verified
- Dogfood flow: interview gate blocks seed before completion, seed validates
  and saves, HostCapability selects `.samvil/next-skill.json` on Codex, standard
  tier routes seed → council → design, Council decision promotes to ADR, claims
  are posted for interview/seed/council exits, and Manifest context includes
  the app file.
- Full test suite: 761 passed.
- `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: PASS.

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-04-26 — 4-Layer Portability Foundation

Phase 1 of the multi-host SAMVIL architecture. This release separates the
harness into Skill / MCP / Host Adapter / SSOT layers so future Codex,
OpenCode, and larger-app support can build on explicit contracts instead of
Claude Code assumptions.

### Added
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/manifest.py` + 4 MCP tools for Codebase Manifest build,
  read, render, and refresh. Manifest writes to `.samvil/manifest.json`.
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/decision_log.py` + 6 MCP tools for PM-readable ADRs under
  `.samvil/decisions/*.md`, including supersession and council promotion.
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/orchestrator.py` + 5 MCP tools for next-stage lookup,
  skip policy, proceed/block checks, event-derived state, and `complete_stage`.
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/host.py` + 2 MCP tools for `HostCapability` and chain
  strategy resolution across Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, and generic
  hosts.
- Schema references: `references/manifest-schema.md`,
  `references/decision-log-schema.md`, `references/orchestrator-schema.md`,
  `references/host-capability-schema.md`.
- Phase 2 planning document for the next mass-migration step.

### Changed
- `skills/samvil-seed/SKILL.md` is now an 87-line ultra-thin, host-aware PoC.
  The previous 512-line body is preserved as `SKILL.legacy.md`.
- `skills/samvil-council/SKILL.md` now promotes council decision rows to ADRs
  through `promote_council_decision` on a best-effort basis.
- Versioning policy now allows minor versions such as `3.10.0` through
  `3.99.0`; minor reaching 10 no longer auto-promotes to major.

### Verified
- Full test suite: 758 passed.
- MCP server import smoke: 121 tools.
- 4-layer integration smoke: Manifest + Decision Log + Orchestrator +
  HostCapability passed.
- `bash scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: PASS.

## [3.2.3] — 2026-04-25 — README onboarding (contributors + end-users)

Docs-only patch. No code or skill behavior change.

### Added
- `README.md` gains a "SAMVIL 자체를 개선하려면 (Contributors)" section
  covering the 4-step local dev setup: clone → `bash scripts/install-git-
  hooks.sh` (mandatory, 1× per clone) → `mcp/` venv → pre-commit-check
  verification. End-users who only run `/samvil "..."` still read only
  the "빠른 시작" section.
- `README.md` v3.2.x patch changelog block (v3.2.1 / v3.2.2 / v3.2.3)
  so history is visible from the top-level README, not only CHANGELOG.md.
- `skills/samvil-update/SKILL.md` Step 6.5 distinguishes end-user
  upgrade path (no clone, no hooks — everything automatic via
  SessionStart + .mcp.json + save_event auto-claim) from contributor
  path (clone + install-git-hooks).

### Unchanged
- All code and pipeline behavior identical to v3.2.2.
- `/samvil:update` on existing installs still works as before (cache
  rename + venv re-install + tool coverage check). End-users see no
  additional prompts.

## [3.2.2] — 2026-04-25 — Development Discipline (CLAUDE.md)

Docs-only patch. No code change. Extends the "pre-commit check" rule
beyond commit time into the entire development workflow, so AI operators
(Claude, etc.) and human contributors apply the same quality bar at
edit time.

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` §"🛑 ABSOLUTE RULE — Development Discipline (not just
  commits)" covering:
  - "Before claiming done" mandatory pre-commit-check.sh execution
  - Edit-time forbidden patterns table
  - Task-type checklists: new MCP tool / new skill / new agent / new
    event_type / schema change / hook script edit
  - Version bump discipline (references pre-push hook)
  - Exception workflow (--no-verify + fix commit + retro observation)
  - AI operator-specific guidance

No user-visible change. End-users running `/samvil` experience the
same pipeline as v3.2.1.

## [3.2.1] — 2026-04-25 — Portability + Pre-Commit Enforcement

Hardening patch. No user-visible feature change; internal safeguards
against the regression class that almost shipped in v3.2.0.

### Fixed
- Removed hard-coded `/Users/<name>/` absolute paths from `.mcp.json`
  (2 spots), `hooks/_contract-helpers.sh` (5 spots),
  `hooks/contract-stage-end.sh` (1 spot), and
  `skills/samvil-doctor/SKILL.md` (6 spots). All replaced with
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` / dynamic resolution.
- `.mcp.json` switched to `uvx --from ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/mcp samvil-mcp`
  (same pattern as Ouroboros), removing the first-install venv race.
- Shell shebangs unified to `#!/usr/bin/env bash` so hook scripts run
  on Alpine / Docker images where `/bin/bash` is absent.

### Added — absolute pre-commit gate
- `scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`: 6-check enforcement (hard-coded paths,
  version sync, glossary, pytest, skill wiring, MCP import) that blocks
  commits on failure.
- `.githooks/pre-commit`: delegate hook activated via
  `bash scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` (one-time per clone).
- `CLAUDE.md` absolute rule: `--no-verify` reserved for true emergencies
  with a mandatory fix commit in the same session.
- `.gitignore` excludes `.claude/settings.local.json` (machine-local
  permission prompts that would leak worktree paths).

### Verified
- `git ls-files | xargs grep -l '/Users/<name>'` → 0 hits.
- pytest 626 / glossary green / skill wiring PASS / MCP import clean.

## [3.2.0] — 2026-04-24 — Contract Layer

13개 흡수 항목(①~⑬) 전부 반영. v3.2는 "자동으로 앱을 빌드하는 도구"에서

### Added — 3 infrastructure

- **⑪ Glossary + rename sweep** (`references/glossary.md` + `scripts/check-glossary.sh`) — `agent_tier → samvil_tier`, "5 gates" → `evolve_checks`. CI enforcement.
- **⑫ Migration v3.1 → v3.2** (`migrate_v3_2.py`) — backup-first, idempotent, `--dry-run`, mid-sprint rollback snapshot.
- **⑬ Performance budget** (`performance_budget.py` + `performance_budget.defaults.yaml`) — per-tier ceiling, 80% warn, 150% hard-stop, consensus 면제.

### Added — observability + docs

- `samvil status` (v1 MVP) — `scripts/samvil-status.py` (sprint + gates + budget pane, zero LLM calls)
- `samvil narrate` — Compressor-role 1-page briefing. `scripts/samvil-narrate.py` + 파이프라인 종료 시 자동.
- `scripts/view-claims.py`, `scripts/view-gates.py`, `scripts/view-retro.py` (single-topic viewer).
- 12 신규 reference 문서: glossary, gate-vs-degradation, model-routing-guide, model-profiles-schema, troubleshooting-codex, interview-levels, jurisdiction-boundary-cases, council-retirement-migration, migration-v3.1-to-v3.2, calibration-dogfood, contract-layer-protocol, performance_budget.defaults.yaml.

### Added — skill wiring (β plan)

- `samvil-interview` — post_stage `compute_seed_readiness` + `gate_check(interview_to_seed)` + claim post.
- `samvil-build` — pre_stage `route_task(build-worker)` + stage_start claim. Post_stage per-leaf `claim_post(ac_verdict)` + `gate_check(build_to_qa)` + stagnation sniff.

  (기존 이름은 `references/glossary.md` 참조)
- `convergence_gate.py` — docstring에서 "5 gates" → "5 evolve_checks" 리네임 (기능 동일).
- `CLAUDE.md` 상단에 Vocabulary (v3.2) 섹션 추가.

### Fixed

- v3.1 스킬들의 legacy tier 파라미터 사용을 `samvil_tier`로 통일 (기존 이름은 deprecated alias로 여전히 수용; 상세는 `references/glossary.md`).

### Deprecated

- `--council` 플래그 (v3.3에서 제거).
- legacy MCP 파라미터 (v3.3에서 제거; 이름은 `references/glossary.md` 참조).

### Tests

### Known gaps (deferred to v3.2.1 / v3.3)

- 자동 rollback CLI (`samvil-update --rollback v3.2`) — 스냅샷은 있지만 복원 루틴 미구현. 수동 복원 가능.
- 실제 dogfood 1회가 아직 미실행 — synthetic bootstrap observation만 있음. 사용자 실행 후 real observation 주입.
- seed / design / scaffold / deploy / evolve 5개 스킬의 contract layer 결선은 β 설계상 의도 제외. 필요 시 각 15~20줄 추가로 완성 가능.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-21 — Interview Renaissance + Stability + Universal Builder

Post-v3.0.0 dogfood (vampire-survivors + game-asset-gen) surfaced 27 backlog
items. v3.1.0 lands 25 of them (2 remaining are dogfood-dependent, deferred to
v3.1.1). Net effect: seed production-ready depth + GLM/GPT compatibility +
auto stall recovery + Korean-first council output.

### Sprint 0 — Backlog Schema (v3-021)
- `samvil-retro` now writes `suggestions_v2` dict schema (id / priority / component / name / problem / fix / expected_impact / sprint / source). Auto-increments IDs across entries so new retros never duplicate. `scripts/view-retro.py` CLI viewer.

### Sprint 1 — Interview Renaissance (v3-022, v3-023)
- **Deep Mode tier** — `ambiguity ≤ 0.005` + Domain pack 25~30Q. Triggers: `--deeper` flag, "더 깊게" during interview, "아직 부족한 느낌" at Phase 3.
- **Phase 2.6 Non-functional** (thorough+): perf / accessibility / security / data retention / offline / i18n / error UX.
- **Phase 2.7 Inversion** (thorough+): failure path premortem / anti-requirements / abuse vectors.
- **Phase 2.8 Stakeholder/JTBD** (full+): primary/secondary users + JTBD template + payer + motivation-vs-alternatives.
- **Phase 2.9 Customer Lifecycle** (standard+): 8 stages Discovery → Churn. Pulls AARRR/HEART/JTBD frameworks behind the scenes without exposing the acronyms to the user.
- References: `interview-frameworks.md` + `interview-question-bank.md` (110 questions across common + 5 domain packs).
- Seed schema: `customer_lifecycle`, `non_functional`, `inversion`, `stakeholders` objects.

### Sprint 2 — Stability CRITICAL (v3-016, v3-017, v3-019)
- **Stall detection for design/council/evolve** — `state.json`-driven heartbeat complements the events.jsonl-based `detect_stall` (v2.6.0). 4 new MCP tools: `heartbeat_state`, `is_state_stalled`, `build_reawake_message`, `increment_stall_recovery_count`.
- `samvil-design` Step 3a-3d + `samvil-council` Step 2a integrate pre-spawn announcement + per-agent progress + between-batch stall check. Regression case from mobile-game dogfood (25-minute hang) now auto-recovers within 5 minutes.
- **Model compatibility** (`references/model-specific-prompts.md`): Claude/GLM/GPT per-stage guidance. Measured 6×+ Sonnet-vs-GLM gap surfaced in docs, **not** enforced as rejection.
- **Auto-chain policy** (`state-schema.auto_chain`): pipeline stages chain without user approval by default. Interview/Seed still require confirmation. Legacy `'go' to proceed` prompts removed.

### Sprint 3 — Game Domain + Automation Scaffold (v3-013, v3-014, v3-015, v3-025)
- `game-interviewer` agent expanded with 3 new question blocks: lifecycle architecture (solo/multi, login, save, ranking, IAP), mobile spec (resolution, orientation, input, supported devices), art direction.
- `agents/game-art-architect.md` new — translates `seed.art_design` into Phaser-ready specs (sprite strategy, palette, HUD layout, animation plan, audio spec). Spawned by `samvil-design` when `solution_type == "game"`.
- Seed schema: `game_config`, `game_architecture`, `art_design` objects (no more 800×600 default).
- `samvil-scaffold` automation: external API model IDs externalized to `.env.example` per `seed.external_api_config.providers`. `game-asset-gen` regression (Gemini hardcoded → 404) now impossible.

### Sprint 5 — Polish (v3-005, v3-006, v3-008, v3-009, v3-018, v3-020, v3-024)
- `samvil-update` Step 1 fallback (plugin.json missing/corrupt → explicit "unknown" + folder name), Step 5a folder rename so `cache/samvil/samvil/3.0.0/` → `3.1.0/` after rsync.
- `agents/reflect-proposer.md`: AC Tree Mutation Rules section — node shape, allowed mutations (add/split/merge/remove/update), status transitions, evidence requirements.
- `test_stage_enum_sync.py` pins Stage enum vs state-schema so council/design can't silently drop out of the enum.
- `references/cost-aware-mode.md` — GLM-main + Claude-sub pattern as first-class supported workflow.
- README + `samvil-doctor` Step 10: per-stage recommended model table with the 6x+ measurement cited.
- `references/council-korean-style.md` — 6 council agents route their output through the Korean-first style guide (labels in Korean, English jargon parenthesized, "왜 문제인가" line for BLOCKING findings).

### Sprint 6 — Long Tail (v3-010, v3-011, v3-012)
- Atomic counter for `_HEALTH_OK_SAMPLE_RATE` (threading.Lock), so concurrent MCP calls don't lose increments or mis-sample.
- `suggest_ac_split` MCP tool + `ac_split.py` heuristic for evolve cycle — detects compound connectors / multi-verb / many-commas and proposes a split.
- `hooks/setup-mcp.sh` SessionStart tool coverage check — diffs expected tools against what the server exposes.

### Sprint 4 — Dogfood preparation (v3-026, v3-027)
- `samvil-build` Phase A.6 Scaffold Sanity Check: empty config files / unsubstituted `{{VARS}}` / broken imports detected before Phase B-Tree.
- `samvil-qa` Pass 1b API Connectivity Check for automation — probes each provider in `seed.external_api_config.providers`, warns on 401/403/429, fails on 404 (deprecated model).
- Remaining dogfood items (v3-001~004, v3-007) defer to v3.1.1 once dogfood sessions produce measurement data.

### Tests

- 375 → 406 (+31): retro schema 5 · deep-mode interview 9 · state-based stall 11 · stage enum sync 3 · atomic counter 2 · AC split 6.

### Migration

- No breaking seed schema changes. v3.0.0 seeds load unchanged. New optional fields populate when interview goes through the new phases.
- Retro entries from before v3.0.1 keep legacy `suggestions` string array; new entries always use `suggestions_v2`.

### Known follow-ups (v3.1.1)

- v3-001: real Next.js dogfood end-to-end (web-app type)
- v3-002: 50+ AC Phase B-Tree measurement
- v3-003: Worker contract real-call capture
- v3-004: `_log_mcp_health` sampling tune with production data
- v3-007: PM-interview live user run

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-19 — 🌳 AC Tree Era (BREAKING)

Sprint 3 converts SAMVIL's acceptance-criteria handling from flat lists to a
tree structure with leaf-level build/QA execution. **v2.x seeds need
migration** — see `references/migration-v2-to-v3.md`.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- `seed.features[].acceptance_criteria` is now a tree of `{id, description, children[], status, evidence[]}` nodes.
- `seed.schema_version` is required and defaults to `"3.0"`. v2.x seeds still load but Phase B auto-migrates them (backup written to `project.v2.backup.json`).
- Build/QA iterate **leaves**, not features. Flat v2 ACs become single-leaf branches after migration, so visible behavior is unchanged for simple seeds.

### T1 — AC Tree Build/QA (4 commits)

- **Tree traversal helpers** (`mcp/samvil_mcp/ac_tree.py`): `is_branch_complete`, `all_done`, `next_buildable_leaves`, `tree_progress`. Honors blocked parents, completed sets, `max_parallel`.
- **Migration module** (`mcp/samvil_mcp/migrations.py`): `migrate_seed_v2_to_v3` + `migrate_with_backup` (idempotent, writes sidecar backup).
- **MCP tools** (server.py): `next_buildable_leaves`, `tree_progress`, `update_leaf_status`, `migrate_seed`, `migrate_seed_file`.
- **samvil-build rewrite** (`skills/samvil-build/SKILL.md`): Phase B-Tree replaces feature-batch dispatch. Legacy Phase B retained as documentation for Dynamic Parallelism / Independence Check / Worker Context Budget (all reused by tree path).
- **samvil-qa aggregation** (`skills/samvil-qa/SKILL.md`): Pass 2 iterates leaves; branch verdicts come from `aggregate_status`; report renders the tree; `qa-results.json` stores `schema_version: "3.0"`.
- **samvil-update --migrate** (`skills/samvil-update/SKILL.md`): post-update Step 7 detects v2.x seeds and offers migration; `--migrate` flag runs migration standalone.

### T2 — LLM Dependency Planning

- `mcp/samvil_mcp/dependency_analyzer.py`: Kahn's toposort with serial-only stage splitting, cycle detection, structured + LLM-inferred dep merging.
- MCP tool `analyze_ac_dependencies` (JSON-in / plan-out).
- samvil-build Phase B-Tree Step 2.5: optional plan for tier ≥ thorough and ≥ 5 ACs. `full` tier invokes LLM from the skill layer.

### T3 — Shared Rate Budget

- `mcp/samvil_mcp/rate_budget.py`: file-based cooperative slot tracker (`acquire`, `release`, `stats`, `reset`).
- MCP tools: `rate_budget_acquire`, `rate_budget_release`, `rate_budget_stats`, `rate_budget_reset`.
- samvil-build Phase B-Tree: acquire before spawn, release after return, summary event at feature end.

### T4 — PM Interview Mode

- New optional entry point skill `samvil-pm-interview` (vision → users → metrics → epics → tasks → ACs).
- `mcp/samvil_mcp/pm_seed.py`: `validate_pm_seed` + `pm_seed_to_eng_seed` (flattens epics/tasks into v3 features).
- `references/pm-seed-schema.md` documents the PM spec shape.
- MCP tools: `validate_pm_seed`, `pm_seed_to_eng_seed`.

### Tests

- 254 → 310 (+56): 24 AC tree helpers / migrations, 14 dependency analyzer, 8 rate budget, 10 PM seed.

### Migration

- `/samvil:update --migrate` runs `migrate_seed_file` standalone in the current project directory.
- Backup is written to `project.v2.backup.json` before rewrite; re-running is idempotent.
- See `references/migration-v2-to-v3.md` for manual recovery.
